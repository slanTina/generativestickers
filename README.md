# THE STORY BEHIND

A Sticker that represents the best of /slantis. It needed to merge:

 - sharing knowledge


## THE CODE

We started our code based on http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_2_6_03

We altered some variables:
- Pendulum color to match /slantis colors
- Pendulum path points represent reprsent /slantis team comments and reactions
- Quantity of the pendulum joints reflect lines /slantis team slack growth
